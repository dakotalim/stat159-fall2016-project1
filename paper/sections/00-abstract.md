# Abstract
In the following paper we will explore the benefits of using Git/Github, Makefile, pandoc, and Markdown to produce a paper following a certain file structure. Git/Github allow collaborators to access an online collaborative version controll platform, for the purposes of this paper there will only be one collaborator. Makefile allows for the automation of some repeatable processes, we will use it to convert and combine several files. The program actually combining said files is pandoc, a text conversion program that allows us to easilly switch between markup (Markdown, HTML, ect.) languages. These technologies allow authors to collaborate and comprehensively record their research methods so that others can follow and reproduce said actions.
