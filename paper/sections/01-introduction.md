# Inroduction
As academics and technology have progressed there has been increasing emphasis on the reproducibility of the experiments or analysis described in papers. Several programs have been developed to help standardize and effectively organize research. In the following paper we will explore the benefits of Git, GitHub, Make, pandoc, and the Markdown language. Git is a version conroll system that allows users to track and save changes made to multiple files and directories with its own committing, branching, and merging system. GitHub is an online platform that uses Git so that multiple collaborators can edit/branch/view the same files. Make is a program that allows us to automate code, allowing users to leave simple, direct instructions as to how and when to run relevant code. Pandoc allows us to convert files from one markup language to another, for the purposes of this paper we will use Markdown and HTML.
